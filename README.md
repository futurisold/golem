`Golem` is a minimalistic framework for performing Bayesian analysis. It was heavily inspired by Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023) course, which is a lovely journey into the scientific thinking. It's built on top of PyTorch, and more specifically, it uses the `torch.distributions` module and the available optimization routines.

My main goal is to have a simple interface to sketch ideas and test them quickly. Caution is advise as the tool should be mainly used didactically to get a better grasp of the Bayesian paradigm.
